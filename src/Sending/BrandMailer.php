/**
 * The one door every mail in this package leaves through.
 *
 * Before this class the two send paths — the immediate `MailChannel` and the
 * digest command — each called `Mail::to(...)->send(...)`. That is the
 * process-wide default mailer with the process-wide From, identically for every
 * brand. The failure is not cosmetic: a relay that verifies sending domains per
 * account replaces a From it does not own, so in a run across several brands
 * the second brand's mail arrives under the first brand's name and address.
 *
 * **Values, not config.** The identity is applied to the message
 * (`Mailable::from()`, `Mail::mailer($name)`) and never written to config. See
 * {@see SenderIdentity} for why a scoped config override with a `finally` does
 * not work here.
 *
 * **Locale travels on the mailable**, not on the app. `Mailable::locale()` is
 * what Laravel wraps the whole render in; `app()->setLocale()` around the send
 * would also change the locale of anything else the render triggers.
 *
 * **A refusal is a return value, not an exception.** A digest run has to skip
 * one brand and carry on with the next, and it has to know before it stamps.
 * Every refusal is logged at error level, throttled per brand so a fan-out
 * cannot bury it.
