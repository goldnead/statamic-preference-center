/**
 * Who a mail goes out as, and over which transport.
 *
 * Every value is nullable and every null means "whatever was true before this
 * class existed": the configured mailer, whatever from-address the mailable or
 * the config settles on, the application locale. A single-brand install
 * resolves {@see self::fromConfig()}, in which all four are null and nothing
 * about the send changes — not even the order in which `Mailable::build()` gets
 * to set its own From.
 *
 * The reason this is a value object rather than four `config()` reads at the
 * call site: the from-address and the transport have to agree. A relay that
 * verifies sending domains per account (Scaleway TEM, Postmark, SES with a
 * verified identity) rejects — or silently rewrites — a From it does not own.
 * Resolving them together makes the pair impossible to split by accident.
 *
 * These are values, never side effects. Nothing here writes to config. Laravel
 * reads `mail.from` the first time a mailer name is resolved and burns it into
 * the mailer instance via `alwaysFrom()`; that instance is then cached in the
 * `mail.manager` singleton for the life of the process. An override of
 * `mail.from.*` inside a scoped window therefore *escapes the window*, even
 * with a `finally` that puts the old value back: whichever brand happened to
 * send first leaves its address standing in the cached mailer, and the next
 * message through it that sets no From of its own goes out as that brand. That
 * is the bug. It is not fixable by being careful with config; it is fixable
 * only by putting the sender on the message.
