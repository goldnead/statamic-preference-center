/**
 * Reads the sender identity out of `brands.settings.mail`.
 *
 * ```
 * settings->mail->from_address   (required once `mail` is present at all)
 * settings->mail->from_name      (defaults to the brand name)
 * settings->mail->mailer         (a mailer from config/mail.php)
 * settings->mail->locale         (the language its mail is written in)
 * ```
 *
 * **Why the transport belongs here and the credentials do not.** One relay
 * account verifies one set of sending domains. This was learned the expensive
 * way: a brand whose domain lived in a different Scaleway project sent through
 * the account that did not own it, and the provider substituted its own
 * verified From — the mail went out under a *foreign brand's* name. A mailer
 * per sending domain in `config/mail.php`, selected per brand here, is what
 * prevents that. The SMTP credentials stay in the environment; putting them in
 * `settings` would carry them into the database, every backup and every CP
 * export.
 *
 * **A brand with no `settings.mail` changes nothing.** It resolves to the pure
 * config identity, so a single-brand install — and every multi-brand install
 * that has not filled the settings in — sends exactly as it did before this
 * class existed. Only once a brand declares a mail identity do the brand-level
 * defaults (from_name ← brand name) apply. This is the line that keeps the
 * addon installable outside the host it was written for, and it is covered by
 * a test of its own.
 *
 * **A brand that declares `mail` but no `from_address` sends nothing.** That
 * is the one case where this class is louder than "unchanged": the brand said
 * it has an identity and then did not give the half that the relay checks.
 * Using the host-wide From instead would put a brand's transport behind
 * somebody else's address — deliverable only if the two happen to belong to
 * the same account, and silently wrong when they do not. Refusing is the
 * smaller failure and it is the visible one.
 *
 * **A mailer name that `config/mail.php` does not define sends nothing either**,
 * and it is caught here rather than at the send. In a digest the send is the
 * wrong place: `DigestBuilder::markSent()` stamps `digested_at` before the mail
 * leaves, so a typo discovered at delivery time costs every recipient their
 * week of items with nothing sent.
